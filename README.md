# Deep-Learning-Challenge

This repo for PROTEINEA TASK
Build and train a GAN that can generate hand-written images of digits (0-9), using PyTorch. Starting from here: https://github.com/amanchadha/coursera-gan-specialization/blob/main/C1%20-%20Build%20Basic%20Generative%20Adversarial%20Networks/Week%201/C1W1_Your_First_GAN.ipynb

Files should run on CUDA and using GPUs
